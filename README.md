### Player Rating App
This is a simple app which uses the ELO rating algorithm to calculate player ratings which are then rendered in the front-end in tabular format

### Technologies
React / Redux (with Redux Saga) and Material-UI for styling

### Instructions
1) ```npm install``` to install all dependancies
2) ```npm generate``` to generate random matches
3) ```npm start-app``` to start both the server and client processes

### Issues

- Chart x-axis (bottom axis) is not responsive enough - implementing some logic to
have a certain number of ticks (time points on x axis) gave strange results. 
- Lots of unit tests still need to be implemented
